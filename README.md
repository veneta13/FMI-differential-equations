Course projects for the Differential Equations and Applications course @ FMI.

## Project 1

### Problem 1

Solve the Cauchy problem, using step sizes of 0.1, 0.02 and 0.002, in the interval [0,5]. Plot the results in a single coordinate system:

Draw a phase portrait and classify the equilibrium points.
Make an animation of the movement of the point (x(t), y(t)) for the solution of the Cauchy problem of the system with initial conditions x(0) = -0.5 and y(0) = -1 for time in [0,4].
