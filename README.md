# FMI-differential-equations
Course projects for the Differential Equations and Applications course @ FMI.

### Project 1
Solve the Cauchy problem, using step sizes of 0.1, 0.02 and 0.002, in the interval [0,5]. Plot the results in a single coordinate system:

<b>
<center>y' =  sin(x<sup>2</sup> + y)</center>
<br>
<center> y(0) = Ï€ / 2 </center>
